Small example showing how to use passport for authenticating requests to a MERN back-end.

## Getting started

You'll first need to download and set-up a **MongoDB** server. The correct server for your OS can be downloaded from [here.](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

Once your **MongoDB** server is up and running use these commands to run the app:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JHarry444/Passport-Local-Example

cd Passport-Local-Example/

npm install

npm start
```
